This means that any human attempting to survive on Mars would need to have access to a reliable source of food, water, and shelter.\n> * **Technology:** Humans would need to have access to advanced technology in order to survive on Mars, including spacesuits, life support systems, and habitats.\n> * **Training:** Astronauts would need to undergo extensive training in order to learn how to live and work in the harsh Martian environment.\n> \n> Given these challenges, it is likely that a human could only survive on Mars for a limited amount of time, perhaps a few months or years. However, with careful planning and the use of advanced technology, it is possible that humans could eventually establish a permanent presence on Mars.\n> \n> In the case of Mark Watney, he is able to survive for over a year on Mars by using his ingenuity and the resources he finds on the planet. He is able to grow potatoes in Martian soil, use his spacesuit to collect water from the atmosphere, and create a habitable environment inside the Hab. He is also able to repair his damaged equipment and communicate with Earth.\n> \n> While Mark's survival on Mars is fictional, it does provide a glimpse into the challenges and possibilities of human survival on the Red Planet."

              "[\"Chapter 1  \\nLOG ENTRY: SOL 6  \\nI’m pretty much fucked. That’s my considered opinion. Fucked. Six days in to what should be a greatest \\ntwo months of my life, and it’s turned in to a nightmare. I don’t even know who’ll read this. I guess \\nsomeone will find it eventually. Maybe a hundred years from now. For the record… I didn’t die on Sol 6. \\nCertainly,  the rest of the crew thought I did, and I can’t blame them. Maybe there’ll be a day of national \\nmourning for me, and my Wikipedia page will say “Mark Watney is the only human being to have died \\non Mars.” And it’ll be right, probably. Cause I’ll surely die  here. Just not on Sol 6 when everyone thinks I \\ndid. Let’s see… where do I begin? The Ares program. Mankind reaching out to Mars to send people to \\nanother planet for the very first time and expand the horizons of humanity blah, blah, blah. The Ares 1 \\ncrew did their thing and came back heroes. They got the parades and fame and love of the world. Ares 2 \\ndid the same thing, in a different location on Mars. They got a firm handshake and a hot cup of coffee \\nwhen they got home. Ares 3. Well. That was my mission. Well, not mine per se. Commander Lewis was \\nin charge. I was just one of her crew. Actually, I was the very lowest ranked member of the crew. I would \\nonly be “in command” of the mission if I were the only remaining person. What do you know? I’m in \\ncommand. I wonder if this log will be recovered before the rest of the crew die of old age? I presume \\nthey got back to Earth all right. Well, guys, if you’re reading this: It wasn’t your fault. You did what you \\nhad to do. In your position I would have done the same  thing. I don’t blame you, and I’m glad you \\nsurvived. I guess I should explain how Mars missions work, for any layman who may be reading this. We \\ngot to earth orbit the normal way, through an ordinary ship to Hermes. All the Ares missions use Hermes \\nto get  to and from Mars. It’s really big and cost a lot so NASA only built one. Once we got to Hermes, \\nfour additional unmanned missions brought us fuel and supplies while we prepared for our trip. Once \\neverything was a go, we set out for Mars. But not very fast . Gone are the days of heavy chemical fuel \\nburns and trans -Mars injection orbits. Hermes is powered by ion engines. They throw Argon out the \\nback of the ship really fast to get a tiny amount of acceleration. The thing is, it doesn't take much \\nreactant mass , so a little Argon (and a nuclear reactor to power things) let us accelerate constantly the \\nwhole way there. You'd be amazed at how fast you can get going with a tiny acceleration over a long \\ntime. I could regale you with tales of how we had great fun on the trip, but I won’t. We did have fun, but \\nI don’t feel like reliving it right now. Suffice it to say we got to Mars 124 days later without strangling \\neach other. From there, we took the MDV (Mars Descent Vehicle) to the surface. The MDV is basically a \\nbig can with some light thrusters and parachutes attached. Its sole purpose is to get six humans from \\nMars orbit to the surface without killing any of them. And now we come to the real trick of Mars \\nexploration: Having all our shit there in advance. A total of 14 unmanned missions deposited everything \\nwe would need for surface operations. They tried their best to land all the supply vessels in the same \\ngeneral area, and did a reasonably good job. Supplies aren’t nearly so fragile as humans and can hit the \\nground really hard. But they tended to bounce around a lot. Naturally, they didn’t send us to Mars until \\nthey’d confirmed all the supplies had made it to the surface and their containers weren’t breached. Start \\nto finish, including supply missions, a Mars mis sion takes about 3 years. In fact, there were Ares 3 \\nsupplies en route to Mars while the Ares 2 crew were on their way home. The most important piece of \\nthe advance supplies, of course, was the MAV. The “Mars Ascent Vehicle.” That was how we would get\\n\\nthe advance supplies, of course, was the MAV. The “Mars Ascent Vehicle.” That was how we would get \\nback  to Hermes after surface operations were complete. The MAV was softlanded (as opposed to the \\nballoon bounce -fest the other supplies had). Of course, it was in constant communication with Houston, \\nand if there were any problems with it, we would pass by Mar s and go back to Earth without ever\\n\\nlanding. The MAV is pretty cool. Turns out, through a neat set of chemical reactions with the Martian \\natmosphere, for every kilogram of hydrogen you bring to Mars, you can make 13 kilograms of fuel. It’s a \\nslow process, though. It takes 24 months to fill t he tank. That’s why they sent it long before we got here. \\nYou can imagine how disappointed I was when I discovered the MAV was gone. It was a ridiculous \\nsequence of events that led to me almost dying. Then an even more ridiculous sequence that led to me \\nsurviving. The mission is designed to handle sandstorm gusts up to 150 km/hr. So Houston got \\nunderstandably nervous when we got whacked with 175 km/hr winds. We all got in our suits and \\nhuddled in the middle of the Hab, just in case it lost pressure. But the  Hab wasn’t the problem. The MAV \\nis a spaceship. It has a lot of delicate parts. It can put up with storms to a certain extent but it can’t just \\nget sandblasted forever. After an hour and a half of sustained wind, NASA gave the order to abort. \\nNobody wante d to stop a month -long mission after only six days but if the MAV took any more \\npunishment we’d all get stranded down here. We had to go out in the storm to get from the Hab to the \\nMAV. That was going to be risky, but what choice did we have? Everyone made  it but me. Our main \\ncommunications dish, which relayed signals from the Hab to Hermes, acted like a parachute, getting \\ntorn from its foundation and carried with the torrent. Along the way, it crashed through the reception \\nantenna array. Then one of those long thin antennae slammed in to me end first. It tore through my suit \\nlike a bullet through butter and I felt the worst pain of my life as it ripped open my side. I vaguely \\nremember suddenly having the wind knocked out of me (pulled out of me, really) and  my ears popping \\npainfully as the pressure of my suit escaped. The last thing I remember was seeing Johanssen hopelessly \\nreaching out toward me. I awoke to the oxygen alarm in my suit. A steady, obnoxious beeping that \\neventually roused me from a deep and p rofound desire to just fucking die. The storm had abated; I was \\nface down, almost totally buried in sand. As I groggily came to, I wondered why I wasn’t more dead. The \\nantenna had enough force to punch through the suit and my side, but then it got stopped by my pelvis. \\nSo there was only one hole in the suit (and a hole in me, of course). I had been knocked back quite a \\nways and rolled down a steep hill. Somehow I landed face down, which forced the antenna to a strongly \\noblique angle that put a lot of torque  on the hole in the suit. It made a weak seal. Then, the copious \\nblood from my wound trickled down toward the hole. As the blood reached the site of the breach, the \\nwater in it quickly evaporated from the airflow and low pressure, leaving only a gunky resi due behind. \\nMore blood came in behind it and was also reduced to gunk. Eventually, the blood sealed the gaps \\naround the hole and reduced the leak to something the suit could counteract. The suit did its job \\nadmirably. Seeing the drop in pressure, it consta ntly flooded itself with air from my nitrogen tank to \\nequalize. Once the leak became manageable, it only had to trickle new air in slowly the relieve the air \\nlost. After a while, the CO2 (carbon dioxide) absorbers in the suit were expended. That’s really t he \\nlimiting factor to life support. Not the amount of oxygen you bring with you, but the amount of CO2 you \\ncan remove. In the Hab, we had the Oxygenator, a large piece of equipment that could break CO2 apart \\nand give the oxygen back. But the spacesuits had  to be portable, so they used a simple chemical \\nabsorption process with expendable filters. I’d been asleep long enough that my filters were useless. \\nThe suit saw this problem and moved in to an emergency mode the engineers call “bloodletting”. Having \\nno w ay to separate out the CO2, the suit deliberately vented air to the Martian atmosphere, then back -\\n\\nno w ay to separate out the CO2, the suit deliberately vented air to the Martian atmosphere, then back -\\nfilled with nitrogen. Between the breach and the bloodletting, it quickly ran out of nitrogen. All it had \\nleft was my oxygen tank. So it did the only thing it  could to keep me alive. It started backfilling with pure \\noxygen. I now risked dying from oxygen toxicity, as the excessively high amount of oxygen threatened to \\nburn up my nervous system, lungs, and eyes.

But it was the\\n\\nhigh -oxygen warning that woke me. The sheer volume of training for a space mission is astounding. I \\nspent a week back on Earth practicing emergency space suit drills. I knew what to do. Carefully reaching \\nto the side of my helmet, I got the breach kit. It’ s nothing more than a funnel with a valve at the small \\nend, and an unbelievably sticky resin on the wide end. The idea is you have the valve open and stick the \\nwide end over a hole. The air can escape through the valve, so it doesn’t interfere with the res in making \\na good seal. Then you close the valve and you’ve sealed the breach. The tricky part was getting the \\nantenna out of the way. I pulled it out as fast as I could, wincing as the sudden pressure drop dizzied me \\nand made the wound in my side scream in  agony. I got the breach kit over the hole and sealed it. It held. \\nThe suit backfilled the missing air with yet more oxygen. Checking my arm readouts, I saw the suit was \\nnow at 85% oxygen. For reference, Earth’s atmosphere is about 21%. I’d be ok, so long as I didn’t spend \\ntoo much time like that. I stumbled up the hill back toward the Hab. As I crested the rise, I saw \\nsomething that made me very happy and something that made me very sad: The Hab was in -tact (yay!) \\nand the MAV was gone (boo!). Right that mo ment I knew I was screwed. But I didn’t want to just die out \\non the surface. I limped back to the Hab and fumbled my way in to an airlock. As soon as it equalized, I \\nthrew off my helmet. Entering the Hab, I doffed the suit and got my first good look at the  injury. It would \\nneed stitches. Fortunately, all of us had been trained in basic medical procedures, and the Hab had \\nexcellent medical supplies. A quick shot of local anesthetic, irrigate the wound, 9 stitches and I was \\ndone. I’d be taking antibiotics for  a couple of weeks, but other than that I’d be fine. I knew it was \\nhopeless, but I tried firing up the communication array. No signal, of course. The primary satellite dish \\nhad broken off, remember? And it took the reception antennae with it. The Hab had s econdary and \\ntertiary communication systems, but they were both just for talking to the MAV, which would use its \\nmuch more powerful systems to relay to Hermes. Thing is, that only works if the MAV is still around. I \\nhad no way to talk to Hermes. In time, I  could locate the dish out on the surface, but it would take weeks \\nfor me to rig up any repairs, and that would be too late. In an abort, Hermes would leave orbit within 24 \\nhours. The orbital dynamics made the trip safer and shorter the earlier you left, s o why wait for no \\nreason just to make the trip take longer? Checking out my suit, I saw the antenna had plowed through \\nmy biomonitor computer. When on an EVA, all the crew’s suits are networked so we can see each others \\nstatus. The rest of the crew would h ave seen the pressure in my suit drop to nearly 0, followed \\nimmediately by my biosigns going flat. Add to that I was sent tumbling down a hill with a spear through \\nme in the middle of a sandstorm… yeah. They thought I was dead. How could they not? They may  have \\neven had a brief discussion about recovering my body, but regulations were clear. In the event a \\ncrewman died on Mars, he stayed on Mars. Leaving his body behind reduced weight for the MAV on the \\ntrip back. That meant more disposable fuel and a large r margin of error for the return thrust. No point in \\ngiving that up for sentimentality. So that’s the situation. I’m stranded on Mars. I have no way to \\ncommunicate with Hermes or Earth. Everyone thinks I’m dead. I’m in a Hab designed to last 31 days. If \\nthe Oxygenator breaks down, I’ll suffocate. If the Water Reclaimer breaks down, I’ll die of thirst. If the \\nHab breaches, I’ll just kind of explode. If none of those things happen, I’ll eventually run out of food and \\nstarve to death. So yeah. I’m fucked.']"

(right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\\nattention layers running in parallel.\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\\nquery with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by√dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention( Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1√dk.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of qandkare independent random\\nvariables with mean 0and variance 1. Then their dot product, q·k=Pdk\\ni=1qiki, has mean 0and variance dk.\\n4\\n\\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as\\ndepicted in Figure 2.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\nMultiHead( Q, K, V ) = Concat(head 1, ...,head h)WO\\nwhere head i= Attention( QWQ\\ni, KWK\\ni, V WV\\ni)\\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices WQ\\ni∈Rdmodel×dk,WK\\ni∈Rdmodel×dk,WV\\ni∈Rdmodel×dv\\nandWO∈Rhdv×dmodel.\\nIn this work we employ h= 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\\ndk=dv=dmodel/h= 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n•In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN( x) = max(0 , xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff= 2048 .\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by√dmodel.\\n5\\n\\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\\nfor different layer types. nis the sequence length, dis the representation dimension, kis the kernel\\nsize of convolutions and rthe size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\\nLayer Type Complexity per Layer Sequential Maximum Path Length\\nOperations\\nSelf-Attention O(n2·d) O(1) O(1)\\nRecurrent O(n·d2) O(n) O(n)\\nConvolutional O(k·n·d2) O(1) O(logk(n))\\nSelf-Attention (restricted) O(r·n·d) O(1) O(n/r)\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i)=sin(pos/100002i/d model)\\nPE(pos,2i+1)=cos(pos/100002i/d model)\\nwhere posis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto10000 ·2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., z n), with xi, zi∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6'),\n",

Six days in to what should be a greatest \\ntwo months of my life, and it’s turned in to a nightmare. I don’t even know who’ll read this. I guess \\nsomeone will find it eventually. Maybe a hundred years from now. For the record… I didn’t die on Sol 6. \\nCertainly,  the rest of the crew thought I did, and I can’t blame them. Maybe there’ll be a day of national \\nmourning for me, and my Wikipedia page will say “Mark Watney is the only human being to have died \\non Mars.” And it’ll be right, probably. Cause I’ll surely die  here. Just not on Sol 6 when everyone thinks I \\ndid. Let’s see… where do I begin? The Ares program. Mankind reaching out to Mars to send people to \\nanother planet for the very first time and expand the horizons of humanity blah, blah, blah. The Ares 1 \\ncrew did their thing and came back heroes. They got the parades and fame and love of the world. Ares 2 \\ndid the same thing, in a different location on Mars. They got a firm handshake and a hot cup of coffee \\nwhen they got home. Ares 3. Well. That was my mission. Well, not mine per se. Commander Lewis was \\nin charge. I was just one of her crew. Actually, I was the very lowest ranked member of the crew. I would \\nonly be “in command” of the mission if I were the only remaining person. What do you know? I’m in \\ncommand. I wonder if this log will be recovered before the rest of the crew die of old age? I presume \\nthey got back to Earth all right. Well, guys, if you’re reading this: It wasn’t your fault. You did what you \\nhad to do. In your position I would have done the same  thing. I don’t blame you, and I’m glad you \\nsurvived. I guess I should explain how Mars missions work, for any layman who may be reading this. We \\ngot to earth orbit the normal way, through an ordinary ship to Hermes. All the Ares missions use Hermes \\nto get  to and from Mars. It’s really big and cost a lot so NASA only built one. Once we got to Hermes, \\nfour additional unmanned missions brought us fuel and supplies while we prepared for our trip. Once \\neverything was a go, we set out for Mars. But not very fast . Gone are the days of heavy chemical fuel \\nburns and trans -Mars injection orbits. Hermes is powered by ion engines. They throw Argon out the \\nback of the ship really fast to get a tiny amount of acceleration. The thing is, it doesn't take much \\nreactant mass , so a little Argon (and a nuclear reactor to power things) let us accelerate constantly the \\nwhole way there. You'd be amazed at how fast you can get going with a tiny acceleration over a long \\ntime. I could regale you with tales of how we had great fun on the trip, but I won’t. We did have fun, but \\nI don’t feel like reliving it right now. Suffice it to say we got to Mars 124 days later without strangling \\neach other. From there, we took the MDV (Mars Descent Vehicle) to the surface. The MDV is basically a \\nbig can with some light thrusters and parachutes attached. Its sole purpose is to get six humans from \\nMars orbit to the surface without killing any of them. And now we come to the real trick of Mars \\nexploration: Having all our shit there in advance. A total of 14 unmanned missions deposited everything \\nwe would need for surface operations. They tried their best to land all the supply vessels in the same \\ngeneral area, and did a reasonably good job. Supplies aren’t nearly so fragile as humans and can hit the \\nground really hard. But they tended to bounce around a lot. Naturally, they didn’t send us to Mars until \\nthey’d confirmed all the supplies had made it to the surface and their containers weren’t breached. Start \\nto finish, including supply missions, a Mars mis sion takes about 3 years. In fact, there were Ares 3 \\nsupplies en route to Mars while the Ares 2 crew were on their way home. The most important piece of \\nthe advance supplies, of course, was the MAV. The “Mars Ascent Vehicle.” That was how we would get\\n\\nthe advance supplies, of course, was the MAV. The “Mars Ascent Vehicle.” That was how we would get \\nback  to Hermes after surface operations were complete. The MAV was softlanded (as opposed to the \\nballoon bounce -fest the other supplies had). Of course, it was in constant communication with Houston, \\nand if there were any problems with it, we would pass by Mar s and go back to Earth without ever\\n\\nlanding. The MAV is pretty cool. Turns out, through a neat set of chemical reactions with the Martian \\natmosphere, for every kilogram of hydrogen you bring to Mars, you can make 13 kilograms of fuel. It’s a \\nslow process, though. It takes 24 months to fill t he tank. That’s why they sent it long before we got here. \\nYou can imagine how disappointed I was when I discovered the MAV was gone. It was a ridiculous \\nsequence of events that led to me almost dying. Then an even more ridiculous sequence that led to me \\nsurviving. The mission is designed to handle sandstorm gusts up to 150 km/hr. So Houston got \\nunderstandably nervous when we got whacked with 175 km/hr winds. We all got in our suits and \\nhuddled in the middle of the Hab, just in case it lost pressure. But the  Hab wasn’t the problem. The MAV \\nis a spaceship. It has a lot of delicate parts. It can put up with storms to a certain extent but it can’t just \\nget sandblasted forever. After an hour and a half of sustained wind, NASA gave the order to abort. \\nNobody wante d to stop a month -long mission after only six days but if the MAV took any more \\npunishment we’d all get stranded down here. We had to go out in the storm to get from the Hab to the \\nMAV. That was going to be risky, but what choice did we have? Everyone made  it but me. Our main \\ncommunications dish, which relayed signals from the Hab to Hermes, acted like a parachute, getting \\ntorn from its foundation and carried with the torrent. Along the way, it crashed through the reception \\nantenna array. Then one of those long thin antennae slammed in to me end first. It tore through my suit \\nlike a bullet through butter and I felt the worst pain of my life as it ripped open my side. I vaguely \\nremember suddenly having the wind knocked out of me (pulled out of me, really) and  my ears popping \\npainfully as the pressure of my suit escaped. The last thing I remember was seeing Johanssen hopelessly \\nreaching out toward me. I awoke to the oxygen alarm in my suit. A steady, obnoxious beeping that \\neventually roused me from a deep and p rofound desire to just fucking die. The storm had abated; I was \\nface down, almost totally buried in sand. As I groggily came to, I wondered why I wasn’t more dead.

              " Document(page_content=\"Chapter 1  \\nLOG ENTRY: SOL 6  \\nI’m pretty much fucked. That’s my considered opinion. Fucked. Six days in to what should be a greatest \\ntwo months of my life, and it’s turned in to a nightmare. I don’t even know who’ll read this. I guess \\nsomeone will find it eventually. Maybe a hundred years from now. For the record… I didn’t die on Sol 6. \\nCertainly,  the rest of the crew thought I did, and I can’t blame them. Maybe there’ll be a day of national \\nmourning for me, and my Wikipedia page will say “Mark Watney is the only human being to have died \\non Mars.” And it’ll be right, probably. Cause I’ll surely die  here. Just not on Sol 6 when everyone thinks I \\ndid. Let’s see… where do I begin? The Ares program. Mankind reaching out to Mars to send people to \\nanother planet for the very first time and expand the horizons of humanity blah, blah, blah. The Ares 1 \\ncrew did their thing and came back heroes. They got the parades and fame and love of the world. Ares 2 \\ndid the same thing, in a different location on Mars. They got a firm handshake and a hot cup of coffee \\nwhen they got home. Ares 3. Well. That was my mission. Well, not mine per se. Commander Lewis was \\nin charge. I was just one of her crew. Actually, I was the very lowest ranked member of the crew. I would \\nonly be “in command” of the mission if I were the only remaining person. What do you know? I’m in \\ncommand. I wonder if this log will be recovered before the rest of the crew die of old age? I presume \\nthey got back to Earth all right. Well, guys, if you’re reading this: It wasn’t your fault. You did what you \\nhad to do. In your position I would have done the same  thing. I don’t blame you, and I’m glad you \\nsurvived. I guess I should explain how Mars missions work, for any layman who may be reading this. We \\ngot to earth orbit the normal way, through an ordinary ship to Hermes. All the Ares missions use Hermes \\nto get  to and from Mars. It’s really big and cost a lot so NASA only built one. Once we got to Hermes, \\nfour additional unmanned missions brought us fuel and supplies while we prepared for our trip. Once \\neverything was a go, we set out for Mars. But not very fast . Gone are the days of heavy chemical fuel \\nburns and trans -Mars injection orbits. Hermes is powered by ion engines. They throw Argon out the \\nback of the ship really fast to get a tiny amount of acceleration. The thing is, it doesn't take much \\nreactant mass , so a little Argon (and a nuclear reactor to power things) let us accelerate constantly the \\nwhole way there. You'd be amazed at how fast you can get going with a tiny acceleration over a long \\ntime. I could regale you with tales of how we had great fun on the trip, but I won’t. We did have fun, but \\nI don’t feel like reliving it right now. Suffice it to say we got to Mars 124 days later without strangling \\neach other. From there, we took the MDV (Mars Descent Vehicle) to the surface. The MDV is basically a \\nbig can with some light thrusters and parachutes attached. Its sole purpose is to get six humans from \\nMars orbit to the surface without killing any of them. And now we come to the real trick of Mars \\nexploration: Having all our shit there in advance. A total of 14 unmanned missions deposited everything \\nwe would need for surface operations. They tried their best to land all the supply vessels in the same \\ngeneral area, and did a reasonably good job. Supplies aren’t nearly so fragile as humans and can hit the \\nground really hard. But they tended to bounce around a lot. Naturally, they didn’t send us to Mars until \\nthey’d confirmed all the supplies had made it to the surface and their containers weren’t breached. Start \\nto finish, including supply missions, a Mars mis sion takes about 3 years. In fact, there were Ares 3 \\nsupplies en route to Mars while the Ares 2 crew were on their way home. The most important piece of \\nthe advance supplies, of course, was the MAV. The “Mars Ascent Vehicle.” That was how we would get\\n\\nthe advance supplies, of course, was the MAV. The “Mars Ascent Vehicle.” That was how we would get \\nback  to Hermes after surface operations were complete. The MAV was softlanded (as opposed to the \\nballoon bounce -fest the other supplies had). Of course, it was in constant communication with Houston, \\nand if there were any problems with it, we would pass by Mar s and go back to Earth without ever\\n\\nlanding. The MAV is pretty cool. Turns out, through a neat set of chemical reactions with the Martian \\natmosphere, for every kilogram of hydrogen you bring to Mars, you can make 13 kilograms of fuel. It’s a \\nslow process, though. It takes 24 months to fill t he tank. That’s why they sent it long before we got here. \\nYou can imagine how disappointed I was when I discovered the MAV was gone. It was a ridiculous \\nsequence of events that led to me almost dying. Then an even more ridiculous sequence that led to me \\nsurviving. The mission is designed to handle sandstorm gusts up to 150 km/hr. So Houston got \\nunderstandably nervous when we got whacked with 175 km/hr winds. We all got in our suits and \\nhuddled in the middle of the Hab, just in case it lost pressure. But the  Hab wasn’t the problem. The MAV \\nis a spaceship. It has a lot of delicate parts. It can put up with storms to a certain extent but it can’t just \\nget sandblasted forever. After an hour and a half of sustained wind, NASA gave the order to abort. \\nNobody wante d to stop a month -long mission after only six days but if the MAV took any more \\npunishment we’d all get stranded down here. We had to go out in the storm to get from the Hab to the \\nMAV. That was going to be risky, but what choice did we have? Everyone made  it but me. Our main \\ncommunications dish, which relayed signals from the Hab to Hermes, acted like a parachute, getting \\ntorn from its foundation and carried with the torrent. Along the way, it crashed through the reception \\nantenna array. Then one of those long thin antennae slammed in to me end first. It tore through my suit \\nlike a bullet through butter and I felt the worst pain of my life as it ripped open my side. I vaguely \\nremember suddenly having the wind knocked out of me (pulled out of me, really) and  my ears popping \\npainfully as the pressure of my suit escaped. The last thing I remember was seeing Johanssen hopelessly \\nreaching out toward me. I awoke to the oxygen alarm in my suit. A steady, obnoxious beeping that \\neventually roused me from a deep and p rofound desire to just fucking die. The storm had abated; I was \\nface down, almost totally buried in sand. As I groggily came to, I wondered why I wasn’t more dead. The \\nantenna had enough force to punch through the suit and my side, but then it got stopped by my pelvis. \\nSo there was only one hole in the suit (and a hole in me, of course).
