I would \\nonly be \\342\\200\\234in command\\342\\200\\235 of the mission if I were the only remaining person. What do you know? I\\342\\200\\231m in \\ncommand. I wonder if this log will be recovered before the rest of the crew die of old age? I presume \\nthey got back to Earth all right. Well, guys, if you\\342\\200\\231re reading this: It wasn\\342\\200\\231t your fault. You did what you \\nhad to do. In your position I would have done the same  thing. I don\\342\\200\\231t blame you, and I\\342\\200\\231m glad you \\nsurvived. I guess I should explain how Mars missions work, for any layman who may be reading this. We \\ngot to earth orbit the normal way, through an ordinary ship to Hermes. All the Ares missions use Hermes \\nto get  to and from Mars. It\\342\\200\\231s really big and cost a lot so NASA only built one.\"\n",

He also begins growing potatoes in the Martian soil, but it takes time for the potatoes to grow.\n> * **Water:** Watney has a limited supply of water, and he must recycle and reuse it as much as possible. He also extracts water from the Martian atmosphere using a device called a MOXIE (Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment).\n> * **Oxygen:** Watney has a limited supply of oxygen, and he must use it sparingly. He also generates oxygen using a device called an O2 generator.\n> * **Radiation:** Mars is exposed to high levels of radiation, which can be harmful to humans. Watney must take precautions to protect himself from radiation, such as staying inside his habitat module as much as possible.\n> * **Temperature:** Temperatures on Mars can vary greatly, from extremely hot during the day to extremely cold at night. Watney must maintain a comfortable temperature inside his habitat module.\n> \n> Given these limitations, it is difficult to say exactly how long Watney could survive on Mars. However, he is a resourceful and determined individual, and he is able to use his knowledge and skills to overcome the challenges he faces.\n> \n> In the film adaptation of The Martian, Watney is stranded on Mars for 549 days (about 18 months) before he is rescued. However, it is important to note that this is a fictional story, and it is unlikely that a real astronaut could survive on Mars for that long.\n> \n> Ultimately, Watney's ability to survive on Mars would depend on a number of factors, including the amount of supplies he has, his ability to grow food and generate oxygen, and his ability to protect himself from the harsh Martian environment."

              " Document(page_content='Scaled Dot-Product Attention\\n Multi-Head Attention\\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\\nattention layers running in parallel.\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\\nquery with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by√dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention( Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1√dk.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of qandkare independent random\\nvariables with mean 0and variance 1. Then their dot product, q·k=Pdk\\ni=1qiki, has mean 0and variance dk.\\n4\\n\\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as\\ndepicted in Figure 2.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\nMultiHead( Q, K, V ) = Concat(head 1, ...,head h)WO\\nwhere head i= Attention( QWQ\\ni, KWK\\ni, V WV\\ni)\\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices WQ\\ni∈Rdmodel×dk,WK\\ni∈Rdmodel×dk,WV\\ni∈Rdmodel×dv\\nandWO∈Rhdv×dmodel.\\nIn this work we employ h= 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\\ndk=dv=dmodel/h= 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n•In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN( x) = max(0 , xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff= 2048 .\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by√dmodel.\\n5\\n\\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\\nfor different layer types. nis the sequence length, dis the representation dimension, kis the kernel\\nsize of convolutions and rthe size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\\nLayer Type Complexity per Layer Sequential Maximum Path Length\\nOperations\\nSelf-Attention O(n2·d) O(1) O(1)\\nRecurrent O(n·d2) O(n) O(n)\\nConvolutional O(k·n·d2) O(1) O(logk(n))\\nSelf-Attention (restricted) O(r·n·d) O(1) O(n/r)\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i)=sin(pos/100002i/d model)\\nPE(pos,2i+1)=cos(pos/100002i/d model)\\nwhere posis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto10000 ·2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., z n), with xi, zi∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6'),\n",

You did what you \\nhad to do. In your position I would have done the same  thing. I don’t blame you, and I’m glad you \\nsurvived. I guess I should explain how Mars missions work, for any layman who may be reading this. We \\ngot to earth orbit the normal way, through an ordinary ship to Hermes. All the Ares missions use Hermes \\nto get  to and from Mars. It’s really big and cost a lot so NASA only built one. Once we got to Hermes, \\nfour additional unmanned missions brought us fuel and supplies while we prepared for our trip. Once \\neverything was a go, we set out for Mars. But not very fast . Gone are the days of heavy chemical fuel \\nburns and trans -Mars injection orbits. Hermes is powered by ion engines. They throw Argon out the \\nback of the ship really fast to get a tiny amount of acceleration. The thing is, it doesn't take much \\nreactant mass , so a little Argon (and a nuclear reactor to power things) let us accelerate constantly the \\nwhole way there. You'd be amazed at how fast you can get going with a tiny acceleration over a long \\ntime. I could regale you with tales of how we had great fun on the trip, but I won’t. We did have fun, but \\nI don’t feel like reliving it right now. Suffice it to say we got to Mars 124 days later without strangling \\neach other. From there, we took the MDV (Mars Descent Vehicle) to the surface. The MDV is basically a \\nbig can with some light thrusters and parachutes attached. Its sole purpose is to get six humans from \\nMars orbit to the surface without killing any of them. And now we come to the real trick of Mars \\nexploration: Having all our shit there in advance. A total of 14 unmanned missions deposited everything \\nwe would need for surface operations. They tried their best to land all the supply vessels in the same \\ngeneral area, and did a reasonably good job. Supplies aren’t nearly so fragile as humans and can hit the \\nground really hard. But they tended to bounce around a lot. Naturally, they didn’t send us to Mars until \\nthey’d confirmed all the supplies had made it to the surface and their containers weren’t breached. Start \\nto finish, including supply missions, a Mars mis sion takes about 3 years. In fact, there were Ares 3 \\nsupplies en route to Mars while the Ares 2 crew were on their way home. The most important piece of \\nthe advance supplies, of course, was the MAV. The “Mars Ascent Vehicle.” That was how we would get\\n\\nthe advance supplies, of course, was the MAV. The “Mars Ascent Vehicle.” That was how we would get \\nback  to Hermes after surface operations were complete. The MAV was softlanded (as opposed to the \\nballoon bounce -fest the other supplies had). Of course, it was in constant communication with Houston, \\nand if there were any problems with it, we would pass by Mar s and go back to Earth without ever\\n\\nlanding. The MAV is pretty cool. Turns out, through a neat set of chemical reactions with the Martian \\natmosphere, for every kilogram of hydrogen you bring to Mars, you can make 13 kilograms of fuel. It’s a \\nslow process, though. It takes 24 months to fill t he tank. That’s why they sent it long before we got here. \\nYou can imagine how disappointed I was when I discovered the MAV was gone. It was a ridiculous \\nsequence of events that led to me almost dying. Then an even more ridiculous sequence that led to me \\nsurviving. The mission is designed to handle sandstorm gusts up to 150 km/hr. So Houston got \\nunderstandably nervous when we got whacked with 175 km/hr winds. We all got in our suits and \\nhuddled in the middle of the Hab, just in case it lost pressure. But the  Hab wasn’t the problem. The MAV \\nis a spaceship. It has a lot of delicate parts. It can put up with storms to a certain extent but it can’t just \\nget sandblasted forever. After an hour and a half of sustained wind, NASA gave the order to abort. \\nNobody wante d to stop a month -long mission after only six days but if the MAV took any more \\npunishment we’d all get stranded down here. We had to go out in the storm to get from the Hab to the \\nMAV. That was going to be risky, but what choice did we have? Everyone made  it but me. Our main \\ncommunications dish, which relayed signals from the Hab to Hermes, acted like a parachute, getting \\ntorn from its foundation and carried with the torrent. Along the way, it crashed through the reception \\nantenna array. Then one of those long thin antennae slammed in to me end first. It tore through my suit \\nlike a bullet through butter and I felt the worst pain of my life as it ripped open my side. I vaguely \\nremember suddenly having the wind knocked out of me (pulled out of me, really) and  my ears popping \\npainfully as the pressure of my suit escaped. The last thing I remember was seeing Johanssen hopelessly \\nreaching out toward me. I awoke to the oxygen alarm in my suit. A steady, obnoxious beeping that \\neventually roused me from a deep and p rofound desire to just fucking die. The storm had abated; I was \\nface down, almost totally buried in sand. As I groggily came to, I wondered why I wasn’t more dead. The \\nantenna had enough force to punch through the suit and my side, but then it got stopped by my pelvis. \\nSo there was only one hole in the suit (and a hole in me, of course). I had been knocked back quite a \\nways and rolled down a steep hill. Somehow I landed face down, which forced the antenna to a strongly \\noblique angle that put a lot of torque  on the hole in the suit. It made a weak seal. Then, the copious \\nblood from my wound trickled down toward the hole. As the blood reached the site of the breach, the \\nwater in it quickly evaporated from the airflow and low pressure, leaving only a gunky resi due behind. \\nMore blood came in behind it and was also reduced to gunk. Eventually, the blood sealed the gaps \\naround the hole and reduced the leak to something the suit could counteract. The suit did its job \\nadmirably. Seeing the drop in pressure, it consta ntly flooded itself with air from my nitrogen tank to \\nequalize. Once the leak became manageable, it only had to trickle new air in slowly the relieve the air \\nlost. After a while, the CO2 (carbon dioxide) absorbers in the suit were expended. That’s really t he \\nlimiting factor to life support. Not the amount of oxygen you bring with you, but the amount of CO2 you \\ncan remove. In the Hab, we had the Oxygenator, a large piece of equipment that could break CO2 apart \\nand give the oxygen back. But the spacesuits had  to be portable, so they used a simple chemical \\nabsorption process with expendable filters. I’d been asleep long enough that my filters were useless. \\nThe suit saw this problem and moved in to an emergency mode the engineers call “bloodletting”. Having \\nno w ay to separate out the CO2, the suit deliberately vented air to the Martian atmosphere, then back -\\n\\nno w ay to separate out the CO2, the suit deliberately vented air to the Martian atmosphere, then back -\\nfilled with nitrogen. Between the breach and the bloodletting, it quickly ran out of nitrogen. All it had \\nleft was my oxygen tank. So it did the only thing it  could to keep me alive. It started backfilling with pure \\noxygen. I now risked dying from oxygen toxicity, as the excessively high amount of oxygen threatened to \\nburn up my nervous system, lungs, and eyes. An ironic death for someone with a leaky space sui t: too \\nmuch oxygen. Every step of the way would have had beeping alarms, alerts, and warnings. But it was the\"),\n",

After an hour and a half of sustained wind, NASA gave the order to abort. \\nNobody wante d to stop a month -long mission after only six days but if the MAV took any more \\npunishment we’d all get stranded down here. We had to go out in the storm to get from the Hab to the \\nMAV. That was going to be risky, but what choice did we have? Everyone made  it but me. Our main \\ncommunications dish, which relayed signals from the Hab to Hermes, acted like a parachute, getting \\ntorn from its foundation and carried with the torrent. Along the way, it crashed through the reception \\nantenna array. Then one of those long thin antennae slammed in to me end first. It tore through my suit \\nlike a bullet through butter and I felt the worst pain of my life as it ripped open my side. I vaguely \\nremember suddenly having the wind knocked out of me (pulled out of me, really) and  my ears popping \\npainfully as the pressure of my suit escaped. The last thing I remember was seeing Johanssen hopelessly \\nreaching out toward me. I awoke to the oxygen alarm in my suit. A steady, obnoxious beeping that \\neventually roused me from a deep and p rofound desire to just fucking die. The storm had abated; I was \\nface down, almost totally buried in sand. As I groggily came to, I wondered why I wasn’t more dead. The \\nantenna had enough force to punch through the suit and my side, but then it got stopped by my pelvis. \\nSo there was only one hole in the suit (and a hole in me, of course). I had been knocked back quite a \\nways and rolled down a steep hill. Somehow I landed face down, which forced the antenna to a strongly \\noblique angle that put a lot of torque  on the hole in the suit. It made a weak seal. Then, the copious \\nblood from my wound trickled down toward the hole. As the blood reached the site of the breach, the \\nwater in it quickly evaporated from the airflow and low pressure, leaving only a gunky resi due behind. \\nMore blood came in behind it and was also reduced to gunk. Eventually, the blood sealed the gaps \\naround the hole and reduced the leak to something the suit could counteract. The suit did its job \\nadmirably. Seeing the drop in pressure, it consta ntly flooded itself with air from my nitrogen tank to \\nequalize. Once the leak became manageable, it only had to trickle new air in slowly the relieve the air \\nlost. After a while, the CO2 (carbon dioxide) absorbers in the suit were expended. That’s really t he \\nlimiting factor to life support. Not the amount of oxygen you bring with you, but the amount of CO2 you \\ncan remove. In the Hab, we had the Oxygenator, a large piece of equipment that could break CO2 apart \\nand give the oxygen back. But the spacesuits had  to be portable, so they used a simple chemical \\nabsorption process with expendable filters. I’d been asleep long enough that my filters were useless. \\nThe suit saw this problem and moved in to an emergency mode the engineers call “bloodletting”. Having \\nno w ay to separate out the CO2, the suit deliberately vented air to the Martian atmosphere, then back -\\n\\nno w ay to separate out the CO2, the suit deliberately vented air to the Martian atmosphere, then back -\\nfilled with nitrogen. Between the breach and the bloodletting, it quickly ran out of nitrogen. All it had \\nleft was my oxygen tank. So it did the only thing it  could to keep me alive. It started backfilling with pure \\noxygen. I now risked dying from oxygen toxicity, as the excessively high amount of oxygen threatened to \\nburn up my nervous system, lungs, and eyes. An ironic death for someone with a leaky space sui t: too \\nmuch oxygen. Every step of the way would have had beeping alarms, alerts, and warnings. But it was the\")]"
